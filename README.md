## NothingNew

A skin for Steam that removes the "What's New" section.

### Why
It's pretty big and annoying. I don't want to see it. Maybe you want the same?

### Compatibility
This skin works with the Steam Client as of 2021-11-20. It can't hurt anything, but functionality with future releases of Steam cannot be known. If you suspect that this skin is failing or interfering with any future version of Steam, just uninstall it and then check back here for an updated version.

### Prerequisite
Know where your Steam folder is located.<br>
These are the default locations as far as I know.
* Windows: `\Program Files\Steam` or `\Program Files (x86)\Steam`
* Linux: `~/.steam/steam` or `~/.local/share/Steam`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/Steam.AppBundle/Steam/Contents/MacOS`

### Installation
1. :truck: Download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/sevenjames/NothingNew/releases)

   - *If there's an old version in there just delete it.*
