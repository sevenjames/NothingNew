This is a skin for Steam that removes the "What's New" section.

It's a totally harmless little CSS hack.

It necessarily includes a duplicate of the default style file "\Steam\resource\styles\steam.styles".
<br>_If Steam ever updates that file then this skin would need an update as well._

Installation:
1. Copy the NothingNew folder into the \Steam\skins\ folder.
1. Restart Steam.
1. Open Steam settings.
1. In the Interface section, select the NothingNew skin.
1. Click OK.
1. Restart Steam.
1. Observe the lack of news.

Uninstallation:
1. Open Steam settings.
1. In the Interface section, select the default skin.
1. Click OK.
1. Restart Steam.
1. Delete the NothingNew folder from the \Steam\skins\ folder.
